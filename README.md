# Neural Networks from Scratch
*NN from Scratch* is a part of my summer (2017) machine learning self-studying project. 

## Overview
The LSTM, CNN, and NTM are implemented with python and numpy. The sources for these algorithm are mainly from their original papers and they have been clearly noted in the notebook themselves. 

## A Learning Project
Since this is a learning project, I have summarized what has gone wrong and what has gone right at the beginning of each notebook. In addition, I put explanations of the theories (or what I am doing) adjacent to the code for further clarification. On that note, there can be errors in my code, if you spot any, feel free to let me know!
